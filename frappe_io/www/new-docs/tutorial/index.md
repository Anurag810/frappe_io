# Frappe Tutorial

## Before you start

This guide is intended for software developers who are familiar with how the web applications are built and served. Frappe Framework is built on Python and uses MariaDB database. For creating web views, HTML/CSS/Javascript is used. So it would be great if you are familiar with all these technologies. At the minimum, if you have never used Python before, you should take a [quick tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) before your use this guide.

Frappe uses the git version control system and is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/frappe/frappe). It is also important that you are familiar with basic git commands.

If you are new to any of these technologies, you can go through the [list of resources](/new-docs/tutorial/before-you-start) we have compiled for you.
